Core Quote Compiler

This is a program I developed to expedite work at my office. It draws information from itemized pdf quotes. Cleans and organizes the data and outputs a formatted excel spreadsheet for faster product searches. Compiling 6-months of quotes ensured that accurate pricing could be estimated. 

Required packages: openpyxl, pyPDF2,
the program requires user input to run
